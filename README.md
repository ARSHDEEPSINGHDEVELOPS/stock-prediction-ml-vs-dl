##  ML vs DL for Stock Price Prediction
A Comparative Study Using Traditional Methods, Machine Learning Models, and LSTM Deep Learning Networks
# Overview
This repository presents a comprehensive comparison of traditional statistical methods, classical machine learning models, and deep learning LSTM architectures for stock price prediction. The analysis is based on Microsoft (MSFT) stock data from 2019 to 2024.
The work accompanies the research paper:
"Leveraging Machine Learning and Time Series Analysis for Stock Prediction: A Review"

# Models evaluated include:
Traditional methods (Average, Weighted Average, Moving Average, Weighted Moving Average)
Machine Learning models (Linear Regression, Weighted Linear Regression, LASSO)
Deep Learning models (LSTM with multiple configurations)
The project aims to compare accuracy, performance, and model behavior for time-series forecasting tasks.
